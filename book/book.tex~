\\If you don't include a * after section, chapter, etc., then it will automatically include a number which can go in contents (if you want a contents page).

\chapter*{Plan}
What would you do if you won a the lottery?
Crazy party to celebrate?
Wouldn't gamble, but bought a raffle ticket and won. Prefer to keep money, as that's 4 cups of coffee. Do you tell your family about your big win? What to do with the money? do you give some money to them? surely not, because poverty stricken people need that money much more then they do, yet you feel obliged to give some to them, yet they don't need it as much as you do.
A friend gets sick, and needs money, which you supply in confidence. Would it be better to give them money, or give it to poverty stricken people. 
Grandparents get money, but how much?
choosing a charity to give the money to.

Later in book, family finds out about the money, and that they didn't get told. Causes issues in the household. 

war - donate money, but where will that go. Refugees - should countries take more. Solving problems with money  is a problem. World overpopulation - should we live in a small world. Honours/epaulettes. 

Unless I lost it under the light, I'll never find it.

people fighting over nothing (sounds vicious, but is pretend)
