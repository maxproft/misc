\section*{\LaTeX\ Hints}
Start book here\\Double slash makes you start a new line. 
You \textbf{cannot} just write on a new line.
\\If you don't include a * after section, chapter, etc., then it will automatically include a number which can go in contents (if you want a contents page).

\chapter*{Plan}
Two steps to write a story:\\
Annecdote: list the actions. There's a guy and he wakes up and he's lying in bed and its really quiet. he so he sits up and he puts his feet on the floor and walks to the door and it is unusally quiet. And he walks down the stairs. It is really really quiet.
You usually want to start with an action.
The bait is that the house is very quiet. the question is why is the house quiet
it is implied that any question that is raised is answered.
\\\\
Moment of reflection - at some point someone needs to say: here is why I'm wasting your time with this story. 
\\\\
What would you do if you won a the lottery?
Crazy party to celebrate?
Wouldn't gamble, but bought a raffle ticket and won. Prefer to keep money, as that's 4 cups of coffee. Do you tell your family about your big win? What to do with the money? do you give some money to them? surely not, because poverty stricken people need that money much more then they do, yet you feel obliged to give some to them, yet they don't need it as much as you do.
A friend gets sick, and needs money, which you supply in confidence. Would it be better to give them money, or give it to poverty stricken people. 
Grandparents get money, but how much?
choosing a charity to give the money to.

Later in book, family finds out about the money, and that they didn't get told. Causes issues in the household. 

war - donate money, but where will that go. Refugees - should countries take more. Solving problems with money  is a problem. World overpopulation - should we live in a small world. Honours/epaulettes. 
 
Unless I lost it under the light, I'll never find it.

people fighting over nothing (sounds vicious, but is pretend)

conversations with clair

Perhaps have several people winning lottery and splitting the money.
1 lives extravagent lifestyle
1 lives for charity.

\chapter{}
He woke with a start when his alarm went off. A few moments of incessant beeps rang across the whole house before it was silenced by the snooze button. He woke again in confusion as to when he fell asleep. the snooze button went off again. His head thumped onto his pillow. With an impending sense of DaJaVu, the alarm went off again. But this time he did not go back to sleep. Instead he lay there, body stressed, ready to pounce when the alarm went off again. It went off, and he pounced. He couldn't lie there much longer. He had to get ready.
\\\\
For the past month he had been amazed when he woke up each morning. He could wake up with 7 hours of sleep, ready to embrace the day without a moment to lose. He got up without an alarm still in wonder at the simple change he had made. Nine hours was not enough time to sleep, but he wasted too much time if he slept any more. He got up, had a shower and put his orange glasses away. Work had led to procrastination which led to internet. In an effort to justify procrastination, finding ways to improve your life were explored, despite the fact that his life would improve if he just finished his work. The internet had so many suggestions on how to fix his life, like meditation, but most of these had the substantial disadvantage that they took time to do. What he needed was a quick fix which money could by. And it did. Orange glasses were cheap, and took up no time since he could work while wearing them. He sat down for breakfast, Vegemite toast as always, and got ready to go.
\\\\
he wouldn't be seen dead wearing his glasses,. But they allowed his body to reset itself. The body clock regulates itself  through the eyes. It can even happen in blind people
He found that wearing his orange glasses . If you thought blind people couldn't tell when it was night and day,. and one to regulate the body clock you were wrong. The eye serves two purposes. One too see (no surprises here). The other purpose is to regulate the body clock. Blue wavelengths are the only ones which matter, so orange glasses which block blue light can simulate sunrise and sunset for your body. this explains why I can sleep at night , when camping, so much better than when I am in a house, sitting in front of my computer until the wee hours.

The two of them walked in together and sat down. he felt so under prepared. He had rocked up in shorts and a shirt, but everyone else here as a 


\chapter{A lack of trust.}
He couldn't believe what they were doing. After sending messages to them, they had still turned him down. "I think it is amiable that you have shown such concern for a fellow resident." I only wish I could say the same about them. What does this sentence reflect about themselves. Clearly they have no concern and are not amiable. 
\\\\
"I stood up for my friend then and I would do it again for any of the people I work with. If you don't wont me to do that, then I don't want to work for you."
\\\\
It's not to say that he supported what his friend had done. Not in the slightest. It was the way he was treated. "You want to form a family here don't you. You want out workplace to be friendly and like a second home. Surely that is one of your hopes."
\\\\
"Well, yes. Of Course"
\\\\
"Of Course. Yet you wouldn't threaten and yell at your children if they did this. You don't lay off your children when times are tough and when they stuff up. Yet this is exactly what you are doing. People don't feel safe here. They think they will lose their job if they stuff up. They live every day in fear of losing their job."
\\\\
A country should be judged, not on how it treats it's good citizens, but on how it treats it's worst ones. You shouldn't fire staff which screw up. You should train them so they can work better. Build a sense of community. 
\\\\
Why won't you drink recycled water? Because of the yuck factor. I have to agree. There's nothing more yucky than drinking the cleanest water on the planet. Nothing so yucky that it is suitable to be used in dialysis. Given the 7 billion people on the planet, each one will drink and pee about 2L of water a day. Over a year, this means that$7 \times 10^9 \times 2 \times 365 \approx 5 \times 10^{12} L$ of water are drunk in a year.

%I feel sorry for peter slipper. A closed, married homosexual. he didn't know how to behave. He had no one to speak to. He was married with children, so his wife was out. He couldn't speak to the church. Then, when these allegations came out, his friends turned their back on him and he had nothing. This is why I like Julia Gillard. She stood up for him when no one else would.
